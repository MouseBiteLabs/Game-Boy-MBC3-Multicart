# Prototype Board Information

Only follow this if you have a v1.0 or v1.1 board!!

## Board Configurations

There are four separate switches to configure, and two different sizes of SRAM to pick from. You also can add a real-time clock to the cartridge for games that needed it.

*Note that you can simply solder bridges from the middle pads of the switches to the left or right to the "ON" or "OFF" positions, instead of installing an actual switch.*

### Real-Time Clock (RTC)

If your game uses an RTC, populate C2, C3, R2, and X1 as indicated in the BOM.

If your game does *not* use the RTC function, you can omit these parts. But you need to bridge the pads of C3.

### SRAM Size Selection

There are two sizes of SRAM you can use, and the type you use will dictate how your save data is stored on the cartridge and if it's shared between games or not.

- If you use a 1 Mbit SRAM (like the AS6C1008), then each game you put on the cartridge will have its own separate save files. If you program multiple copies of the same game, then you can effectively have multiple save files on the same cart. Easy example is Pokemon games - they only let you have one save file, but if you put Pokemon Red on the multicart four times, then that gives you four separate save files!
- If you use a 256 Kbit SRAM (like the AS6C62256) then all the games you put on the cartridge will *share* the same RAM space.  This feature is probably only useful for Pokemon games. As an example: this means that if you made a cart that has Pokemon Red and Blue on it, you would play both versions with the same save data, as save data between the two games are compatible with each other.

### Game Cycling Mode Switch (SW2)

SW2, split into two separate switches SW2A (top half) and SW2B (bottom half), controls how you change games on the cartridge. The following table describes the different settings:

| Mode | SW2A (Top) | SW2B (Bottom) | Game Change Method | Resets the Console? |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1    | OFF        | ON            | Cycle power        | Yes                 |
| 2    | ON         | ON            | Press button       | Yes                 |
| 3    | OFF        | OFF           | Press button       | No                  |
| 4    | ON         | OFF           | No change          | Yes                 |

*Note: Mode 4 will effectively act as a single-game cartridge with an added reset button. This mode does not require populating SW1, U5, and U7. But it requires you to place SW3 into mode C, and restricts your game size to 2 MB and RAM size to 256 Kbit.*

### Game and Save Data Configuration Switch (SW3)

SW3, split into two separate switches SW3A (bottom half) and SW3B (top half), controls the order in which the ROM banks (the games) and the RAM banks (the save data) cycle. This table assumes you are using a 1 Mbit SRAM chip, as a 256 Kbit SRAM will share save data across all ROMs.

| Mode | SW3A | SW3B | ROM Banks  | RAM Banks   | Game 1     | Game 2     | Game 3     | Game 4     |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| A    | ON   | OFF  | 2x 2 MB    | 4x 256 Kbit | ROM1, RAM1 | ROM1, RAM2 | ROM2, RAM3 | ROM2, RAM4 |
| B    | OFF  | OFF  | 4x 1 MB    | 4x 256 Kbit | ROM1, RAM1 | ROM2, RAM2 | ROM3, RAM3 | ROM4, RAM4 |
| C    | ON   | ON   | 2x 2 MB    | 2x 256 Kbit | ROM1, RAM1 | ROM2, RAM2 |            |            |
| D    | OFF  | ON   | 2x 1 MB    | 2x 256 Kbit | ROM1, RAM1 | ROM2, RAM2 |            |            |

*Note: Mode D is useless. Just use Mode C instead.*

### Game Mode Examples

Here's a list of example cartridges you can make with these settings:
1) Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green on one cartridge with separate save files that changes via powering the Game Boy off and on again: **Mode 1B** with 1 Mbit SRAM
2) Pokemon Gold and Silver with the same save file that hotswaps when you press the button on the cartridge (changing games during gameplay): **Mode 3C** with 256 Kbit SRAM
3) Pokemon Crystal with a reset button: **Mode 4C** with 256 Kbit SRAM

## How to Program Games

When using the GBxCart to program multiple games to the cartridge, it's recommended to turn SW2A and SW2B to the OFF position. To change ROM/RAM banks to program, simply press the SW1 tactile button between programming steps. Using FlashGBX's "Refresh" button should show that the game information on the left of the screen changes after pressing the button.

If you're programming the flash chip separate from the board, you'll need to concatenate all the ROM files together into one large 4 MB file to program the chip with.

## Test Points and Final Checkout

On the back of the board are five test points. Here's where they are connected:

- TP1: SRAM supply voltage
- TP2: Battery voltage (after R1)
- TP3: Battery voltage (positive terminal of battery)
- TP4: Ground
- TP5: VCC input voltage

After you assemble your game, you should measure the current out of the battery. But first, you should program it with the GBxCart, or if you programmed the EEPROM separately, put it into a Game Boy and cycle power once. Then, flip the PCB upside down on a non-conductive surface (not your leg), and set your multimeter in DC millivolts (or volts). Put the positive probe on TP3 and the negative probe on TP2. If you used a 10kÎ© for R1, as indicated in the BOM, you should read a voltage in the single or tens of millivolts for non-RTC games, or up to 60 mV for games using a real-time clock. If you have something much higher, especially voltages above 60mV, then you likely have an issue or short circuit on the board somewhere.

### Note about SW1

SW1 can be either short or long. If the button is long enough, it will sit inside the shell in a way that lets you press it by lightly pressing on the cartridge shell. This way, you can activate it without removing it from the console. This is helpful if you want to change games via a button press.

- If you want to make the button pressable when the cartridge is fully assembled, you need to find a switch that has an extended stem on AliExpress, eBay, or Amazon (**if you find a compatible switch on Mouser or Digikey, please let me know**). The measurements will be 5.2 mm x 5.2 mm, with a height of 3.5 mm. Sometimes these parts are listed as "4 mm x 4 mm" or "5 mm x 5 mm" instead. Check the datasheet, if available, to see if it'll fit the footprint. They should have listing pictures similar to the ones seen here:

![image](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-MBC3-Multicart/assets/97127539/57f93dff-8af2-446d-9d30-69dc870ae9df)

- If you don't care about pressing the button while it's in the shell, like if you are making a multicart that changes games by cycling the power where you wouldn't need it, then you can simply use the TS18-5-25-SL-260-SMT-TR (https://mou.sr/3uipCQz).

### Note about MBC3 Revisions

If you have a choice, I recommend against using the original revision-less MBC3 mapper for this specific circuit board. You should use an MBC3A or MBC3B if possible. Save the revision-less MBC3 chips for regular MBC3 cartridges!

![image](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-MBC3-Multicart/assets/97127539/429f5e91-2385-44e5-9e8a-a10cac201266)

### Usable Donor Cartridge Parts

You can use a few parts from the donor cart on the new board to save some money. Note that you will generally get better reliability with new parts as opposed to old ones. For example: I have seen failed RAM chips from donors in the past.

1) **C1, C2, R2, X1: RTC Components** - You can move over these parts if you're using the real-time clock function. Note that C1 and C2 are designated as C2 and C3 on my board. They're the same value, so they're interchangeable.
2) **U2: MBC3A or MBC3B** - This one is required
3) **U3: SRAM** - You can use this part *only if* the sum of the RAM space for the games you're using is the same or less amount of RAM that the donor cartridge has. If you plan to have separate save data for every game, you'll probably need to buy an AS6C1008.

You could probably transfer over most of the 0.1uF capacitors but they're pretty cheap anyway, so I generally just recommend buying new resistors and capacitors.

## Things to Remember

- The 29F032 and 29F033 have been known to occasionally be defective upon arrival. They're either used, or new old stock, and usually only available from AliExpress.
- The footprint for the battery can fit a CR2032, CR2025, or CR2016 with solder tabs. The only difference is the mAh capacity (larger number = longer life). If you get Panasonic tabbed batteries, you may have to trim the battery tabs to make them fit on the footprint.
  - For untabbed coin cells, you can find battery retainer adapters online, <a href="https://retrogamerepairshop.com/products/hdr-game-boy-game-battery-retainer?variant=40511013290156">like this one.</a>
- Generally, ROM sizes are conveyed in terms of kilobytes (KB) and megabytes (KB, MB). RAM size is usually conveyed in terms of kilobits or megabits (Kbit, Mbit). You can convert Kbit and Mbit to KB and MB by dividing Kbit or Mbit by 8. For example, 256 Kbit = 32 KB.
