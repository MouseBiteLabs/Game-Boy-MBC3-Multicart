# Technical Design Document

This write-up will serve as an attempt of explaining how this cartridge functions. I'm not going to explain the majority of the cart, as you can find most of the explanation in <a href="https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-MBC3-Cartridge/tree/main/Technical">my MBC3 repo.</a> Therefore, this write-up will mostly focus on how the multicart portion works and the necessary components to safely implement it.

Please correct me on any information I may have gotten wrong.
